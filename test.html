            <section>
                <p>
                    <h1>  Ada</h1>
                        <p>By the mid-1970s there were many different programming languages 
                        used for many different purposes. The US Department of Defense 
                        found this situation confusing and potentially dangerous, so 
                        they commissioned a new language -- one language to rule (and
                        program) them all. The language was named after Ada Lovelace,
                        the first computer programmer, and it really was a "do everything"
                        language by design.</p>


                        <p>The end of the DoD mandate didn't really mean the end of Ada, though. Because
                        it's very good at producing very reliable code (due to error-checking required
                        in the compilers), you still find Ada in use for medical and some critical 
                        systems programming. It seems destined, though, to gradually fade away in favor
                        of other, less ambitious languages.</p>


                        <h1> Algol</h1>
                        <p>When you start talking about ancient computer languages, it's tough to 
                        go back much farther than Algol. We're talking the trilobite of programming 
                        here. Algol ended up being on the scene at roughly the same time as FORTRAN
                        and COBOL, but its primary legacy to programming is through the languages it
                        spawned, rather than as a heavyweight in its own right.</p>


                        <p>The ALGOL that everyone used as the basis for other languages was ALGOL 60. That
                        gives you a good idea of when major development came to an end. If you remember
                        programming in ALGOL, then you've achieved "OG" status in the software world.
                        If you don't, then enjoy the branches on ALGOL's extensive family tree.</p>


                        <h1> APL</h1>
                        <p>If you want to start a religious war among a bunch of programmers, lob APL into
                        the discussion and walk away. Remember in the introduction, when I said that
                        wouldn't be throwing shade at people who used any particular language? Welcome 
                        to the exception.</p>

                        <p>APL was designed to make it relatively simple to turn complex mathematics into 
                        a program. How math-oriented is the language? Let me put it this way: 
                        A three-dimensional array is a basic data unit.</p>

                        <p>In order to perform all of the mathematical gymnastics in a single line (or 
                        maybe two, if it's really complicated) APL calls upon a wide variety of symbols. 
                        The result is a block of code that is absolutely unintelligible to anyone not 
                        deeply into APL. The language's fans bristle at its description as a "write-only
                        language," but it is in many ways one of the more difficult languages to understand.</p>

                        <p>You can still find APL programmers, generally in physics or math departments where
                        very complicated things are being done.</p>


                        <h1> Forth</h1>
                        <p>Forth is different. Forth was developed as a language
                        to be used for embedded control programming: Programming that results in applications 
                        that are small, efficient, and very reliable in terms of both outcome and execution time.</p>

                        <p>Forth is a stack-oriented language. If you think that the Reverse-Polish Notation HP 
                        used in its classic calculators is still the best way to get results from a handheld
                        calculator, then you're 90% of the way to knowing how to program in Forth. If you 
                        pick up an HP calculator and wonder where the "=" sign went, then you'll have a steeper
                        learning curve to climb.</p>

                        <p> Today, you're most likely to encounter Forth in the embedded world, or within a boot loader
                        project that's part of an operating system build. Outside those areas, Forth is well down 
                        on the list of active languages and more remembered than used.</p>


                        <h1>  LISP</h1>
                        <p>When early artificial intelligence researchers needed a programming language, they 
                        turned to a List Processor -- LISP. Developed in the late 1950s, LISP grew due to the 
                        strength of one of its basic data structures, the linked list. Linked lists turned out 
                        to be very effective mechanisms for dealing with multiple data types in a single structure.
                        In some ways, LISP foreshadowed concepts that came to be used in big data, but in very small, 
                        compact systems.</p>

                        <p>LISP spawned a number of successors, with Scheme the most prominent. After years of steady 
                        decline, LISP has seen a resurgence of late as researchers look for ways to add intelligent 
                        features to smaller systems. Outside the AI world, LISP hasn't prospered -- and if you ever 
                        saw the debugging output from an IBM mainframe implementation of early LISP variants, you'd 
                        understand why. Without indents, the long list of "}" characters at the end of the listing 
                        can be several pages of despair.</p>

                        <p>Have you used GNU LISP or another of its open source variants? Are you still using one of the
                        few major commercial systems on the market? Let us know your LISP experience -- with or without
                        lots of brackets.</p>


                        <h1>  Logo</h1>
                        <p>Have you ever programmed a turtle? If so, then you're probably familiar with Logo, a programming 
                        language designed to teach coding concepts. Starting in the late 1960s, Logo is formally a dialest
                        of LISP. It has a somewhat confusing history because so many people love turtles, but "true" Logo
                        was the entry point into programming for at least one generation of software developers.</p>

                        <p> Seymore Papert was the primary father of Logo. He originally wanted his language to teach people how
                        to write LISP programs, but he realized that many people responded to a physical representation of 
                        the program they had written. When they could watch a "turtle" travel around a screen, they understood 
                        the impact of what they wrote.</p>

                        <p>The confusion came about because there were many languages that used "turtles" and called themselves
                        something like "Logo" while having nothing to do with the real Logo language. As a result, this 
                        logic-oriented language is known by reputation as much as by syntax. If you can find an implementation,
                        though, it's still a great way to teach programming concepts to the young. After all, who doesn't love
                        being able to tell a turtle what to do?</p>


                        <h1>  Modula-2</h1>
                        <p>Niklaus Wirth developed Pascal (more about that later) as a teaching language, but ultimately came to
                        feel that it didn't have all the features a teaching language needed. Rather than endlessly extend and
                        change the language, he developed a new set of languages, Modula and Modula-2.</p>

                        <p>The most significant and visible change brought by Modula and Modula-2 was the idea of the module, and 
                        block of code which can be more or less visible to the rest of the program. (It's controlled by the 
                        programmer.) This "scope limitation" allowed for code that could do all sorts of interesting things on its
                        own, then return results to the main program without spilling all the messy details.</p>

                        <p>While Modula-2 had features that made it a better candidate than Pascal for commercial programming, it
                        never developed the following of its older sibling. It's not gone, but it was almost forgotten before
                        it was truly born.

                        <h1> Pascal</h1>
                        <p>Before Niklaus Wirth developed Modula and Modula-2, the Swiss computer scientist created Pascal. 
                        With Pascal, he brought into the world a language designed for teaching the concepts of structured
                        programming. From the mid-1970s until the mid-1980s it did just that. Along the way, it also became
                        the language that would play a major role in defining programming on the personal computer.</p>

                        <p>In the mid-1980s, if you were programming on an IBM PC there's a good chance you were either using 
                        Microsoft BASIC or Borland's Turbo Pascal. Turbo Pascal was a powerhouse, and different forms of Pascal
                        were used for everything from building the software for the Apple Lisa to writing Donald Knut's TEX system.

                        <p>As structured programming declined in favor of object-oriented programming, Pascal's fortunes declined 
                        as well. You can still find Pascal diehards, but like the French philosopher for whom it was named,
                        Pascal's glory days seem solidly in the past.</p>


                        <h1> RPG (RPG II, RPG III)</h1>
                        <p>IBM's mid-range business systems, from the IBM 1401 through the current IBM Power i Platform, have 
                        been called the most successful commercial computing systems ever. The vast majority of applications
                        written on those machines came through a language developed to run efficiently using punch cards: RPG.</p>

                        <p>The Report Program Generator was a contemporary of FORTRAN and COBOL, and yet it remained stubbornly 
                        rooted to one vendor and one platform. Among the reasons it was so often used was its close link to the 
                        database available on the platforms and the "loop" -- the ability to take a block of code and apply it
                        sequentially to every record in that database.</p>

                        <p>We're now up to RPG IV, and there are still folks out there writing RPG IV code every day. There was
                        a time, though,when newspapers and industry publications were filled with ads seeking RPG programmers.
                        That's no longer true. The same languages that have risen to the top on other platforms are present on
                        Power i, and there are too many application-specific options to have a single, dominant language. I'd 
                        still love to know, though,if your professional life is in RPG. How modern do you think it has become?</p>


                        <h1> Smalltalk</h1>

                        <p>Smalltalk was created by a number of computer science superstars working at Xerox PARC in the late 
                        1970s and early 1980. It had only six reserved keywords and operated on a message-passing model. This 
                        was a form of object-oriented coding in which actions were messages passed to variables and other 
                        entities. It was the mechanism through which many learned the basics of object-oriented programming.</p>

                        <p>When it came to creating commercial code, Smalltalk had a couple of major problems: It needed lots 
                        and lot of memory,and it didn't produce applications that were very fast. You'll still find it used
                        as a teaching tool, but you have to look hard to find significant commercial use.</p>

                        <p>So that's my list of languages that, at the very least, aren't what they used to be. What do you 
                        think? Did I prematurely announce the end of a language? Are there other languages more deserving of
                        a mention on this list? I look forward to your take on the languages that are well down the
                        path to retirement.</p>
